\chapter{The Analytical Method}

The `Analytical Method' (AM) [reference to AM paper] is an algorithm developed for performing muon trigger primitive generation for Phase-2 in the CMS barrel by using information from both DT and RPC systems. It profits from the improved time digitization in Phase-2 DT input hits, 1 ns, much finer than the 25 ns needed for bunch crossing (BX) identification. The muon segment parameters (position and direction) will have a resolution comparable to what is reachable with the present offline reconstruction software \cite{dts:performance_offline}.
